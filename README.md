Now a day we know many peoples are going to buy second hand car instaed of buying new one, because its is better investment option where we get almost 30-40% discount. but main question arise here is how will us know actual selling price of old car base on their features or which factor matters most to determine selling price of car?? So in orer to solve this complex problem, I have build machine learning model which will predict the estimated price of car at which car should be sold base on given features.

- I have made ML model which will predict estimated price of old car base on thier features such as brand,KM drive,Power,Year and so on..
- Completed stepwise EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) then visualizatiion to get some idea about important features or correlation of each feature with output which dominates more to predict price
- Then I have done Feature Engineering which inclueds features extraction & features construction based on my domian knowledge and visualization followed by label encoding
- Train multiples ML models then Analysed & compare performance of differents models based of accuracy and complexity
- Used all regression algorithms to train model and after comparing result of all, got well accuracy by RandomForestRegressor(cross validation--around 90%)
- Finally Build web application using streamlit and deploy the model 
- <https://karanchinch10-oldcar-sell-streamlit-app-p6gwqq.streamlitapp.com/> works too
- Technical tools or library used --Python,Numpy,Pandas,sklearn,matplotllib,html,css,streamlit

To determine class or cateogry of flower which its belong to base on their 4 features or parameters such as sepal length,sepal width, petal length and petal width. Dataset contains total 3 category of flowers of 50 instances each(setosa,virginica,versicolor), where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
